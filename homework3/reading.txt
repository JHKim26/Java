-- Reading --
[IMPORTANT] Page 142 - 145 (Don't read the part on Comparable interface in pg.145)
[OPTIONAL] Page 324 - 346. If you can't understand something, ask me questions during class. This is optional, but given that we have one class left, it'd be helpful if you read ahead.

-- Questions --
[IMPORTANT] please finish the questions on pages 150 - 168
